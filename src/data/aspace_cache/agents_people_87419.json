He attended Riverview Military Academy in Poughkeepsie, New York, and graduated from Yale in 1912. He received a Litt. B. from the Columbia School of Journalism in 1913, worked as a reporter for six months, and traveled to Europe in the spring and summer of 1914. One of the foremost music, art, and literary critics of his day, he published his first essays in the New Republic and Seven Arts. He edited Seven Arts 1916-18, served as music critic for the Dial 1920-27, and was co-editor of The American Caravan 1927-36.\r\n\r\nHe wrote hundreds of articles for such journals as Vanity Fair, the Nation, and Modern Music. Among his seven published collections of essays were Musical Portraits (1920), Port of New York (1924), and Discoveries of a Music Critic (1936). He also wrote an autobiographical novel, The Boy in the Sun (1928).\r\n\r\nPaul Rosenfeld never married and died of a heart attack in New York City on July 21, 1946.",
