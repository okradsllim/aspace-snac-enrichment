In 1898, Runyon enlisted in the U.S. Army during the Spanish-American War and served in the Philippines. After the war, he worked for a number of newspapers in various small towns in Colorado before he was hired in 1905 as a reporter for the Denver Post. He worked briefly in 1906 as a reporter for the San Francisco Post before returning to Denver to work for the Rocky Mountain News, where he covered sports, crime, and court stories. In addition to his newspaper duties, Runyon wrote short stories and poems for national magazines, including Harper\u2019s and McClure\u2019s. In 1910, Runyon moved to New York to work as a sportswriter for the New York American. Runyon published a collection of poems, The Tents of Trouble, in 1911, and during the 1920\u2019s and 1930\u2019s, he published many short stories. In 1932 he published Guys and Dolls, which was made into a popular Broadway musical and film. Motion picture adaptations of two other stories, \u201cThe Lemon Drop Kid\u201d and \u201cLittle Miss Marker,\u201d appeared in 1934. Runyon died 10 December 1946 in New York City.",
