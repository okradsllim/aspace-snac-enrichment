She attended Smith College and the University of Pennsylvania, and took classes at the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania. In 1925 she married Edward Albert Norman (1900-1955), the son of Chicago philanthropist Aaron E. Norman, and settled with him in New York City. There she became involved with the American Civil Liberties Union and other progressive organizations; in later years Norman became a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action, and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. The Dorothy and Edward Norman were also arts patrons, and their town house at 124 East 70th Street was designed for them by the Swiss architect William Lascaze (1896-1969) in the early 1940s.",
