          "content": "Marguerite Moreno was a French theater and film actor. Born Lucie Marie Marguerite Monceau, she adopted her mother's name at the beginning of her career. Moreno was associated with St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 and the symbolist movement, and she was a member of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, 1890-1903. During the 1890s she met the writer Colette, who became a friend and confidant. During 1908-1913, she taught at the conservatory in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Moreno served as a nurse in France during World War I, 1914-1915. By 1915 she was acting in films, and continued working in theater and film through the end of her life. In 1945, she performed the title role in Jean Giraudoux's La Folle de Chaillot.\r\n\r\nMoreno was married to actors Marcel Schwob, 1900-1905, and Jean Daragon, 1908-1923. In the 1920s, she acquired La Source bleue, her home in Touzac (Lot), where she lived with her nephew and companion Pierre Bouyou, an actor who adopted the name Pierre Moreno.",
