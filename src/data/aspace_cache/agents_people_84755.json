He studied law and history at Wittenberg and then returned to Dresden, where he held various positions and maintained a lifestyle rich in activities and connections. In 1796 he was appointed to the city court, and beginning in 1801 held positions of increasing responsibility with the city archive. When Saxony came under Russian control as a result of the Napoleonic wars, Winkler became a government secretary, edited government publications, and attained the rank of Russian privy councilor. By 1814 he was also active in the Dresden theater, rising eventually to vice-director of the court theater. His service to the German stage included his many translations of plays and operas, from French, English, Italian, and Portuguese, all languages in which he was well versed. He also wrote original prose and dramatic works, most of them now forgotten, and edited and published numerous periodicals, some of them influential. Among these publications were the literary annuals Penelope (1811-48) and Dramatisches Vergissmeinnicht (1824-49); the theater monthly Tagebuch der deutschen B\u00fchnen (1815-35); and the newspaper the Dresden Abendzeitung, of which he was the editor from 1817-43. Winkler died in Dresden on 24 September 1856.",
