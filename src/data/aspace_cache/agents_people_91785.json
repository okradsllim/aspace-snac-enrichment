Jones grew up in a wealthy Philadelphia family and married Frederic Rhinelander Jones, Edith Wharton's oldest brother, in 1872. The couple moved to New York City and had a daughter named Beatrix. The marriage lasted twelve years and the couple divorced. In New York, Jones was well-known for hosting Sunday afternoon lunches at her house attended by notable literary figures, such as Edith Wharton and Henry James. During her life, Jones published two books and many articles concerning the welfare of nurses and medical system reform. She was active in the development of the New York City Hospital School and served as the chair for the Advisory Board on Nursing. She vacationed in Bar Harbor, Maine where she volunteered with the local schools and collaborated with residents to create Acadia National Park.",
