For most of his life he worked as a journalist, writing prolifically on a wide range of subjects. A prominent figure of the first wave of Russian emigration, he numbered among his friends and acquaintances most of the notable Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s in France and the United States, many of whom are represented in the papers.\r\n\r\nSedykh was born in Feodosiia, Russia on August 14 (August 1), 1902. He emigrated from Russia in 1920 and, after a brief period in Istanbul, settled in Paris where he studied at the Ecole des sciences politiques receiving his degree in 1925. He worked as a correspondent for Poslednie novosti, Segodnia (Riga) and Novoe russkoe slovo (New York), and in 1932 married the actress and singer Evgeniia Osipovna Lipovskaia (Jenny Grey). When Ivan Alekseevich Bunin was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1933, Sedykh accompanied him to Stockholm for the ceremonies as his secretary. During World War II Sedykh was forced to flee Paris, and in 1942 he emigrated to New York, where he began working as the city editor for Novoe russkoe slovo. He served as its managing editor from 1960-65 and in 1973 became editor in chief and president.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his career as a writer, journalist, and editor, Sedykh was active in philanthropic organizations. He created the Fond srochnoi pomoshchi at Novoe russkoe slovo to aid needy Russian emigrants and promoted the yearly collection for the Russian Literary Fund. He served as president of the Russian Literary Fund and vice-president of the American ORT (Obshchestvo rasprostraneniia truda) Federation, and for many years was the chairman of the executive committee of the American-European Friends of ORT.",
