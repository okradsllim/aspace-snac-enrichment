He majored in French at Yale University, and began photographing seriously in 1962 while serving in army counterintelligence in Vietnam. During the 1960s, he lived in New York City and wrote articles and photographed for the weekly newspaper, Manhattan East. In 1971, Noble moved to New Mexico. Initially, he worked as the record photographer for archaeological excavations by the School of American Research at Arroyo Hondo Pueblo near Santa Fe; he continued to work for the school until 1989. In 2003, Noble received the Victor Stoner Award from the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society in recognition of his \"outstanding efforts to bring historical and archaeological awareness of the Southwest to the general public.\" In 2011, he received the Emil Haury Award from the Western National Parks Association for \"outstanding contributions in scientific research or other activities that advance the understanding and interpretation of the natural and cultural resources of western national parks.\"",
