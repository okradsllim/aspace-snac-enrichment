          "content": "American poet Ann Lauterbach was born on September 28, 1942, in New York City to Richard Edward (a war correspondent) and Elisabeth Stuart Wardewell Lauterbach. She graduated from the High School of Music and Art in New York City and then obtained a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Wisconsin in 1964. She attended Columbia University on a Woodrow Wilson graduate fellowship from 1966 to 1967.\r\n\r\nFollowing her studies, Lauterbach moved to London, England, where she served as an editor for Thames & Hudson Publishers (1967-1973) and taught at Saint Martin's School of Art (1967-1973). During this time Lauterbach was also director of the literature program at the Institute of Contemporary Art. While living in England Lauterbach published her first book of poetry: Vertical, Horizontal (Dublin, Ireland: Seafront Press, 1971).\r\n\r\nLauterbach returned to New York City where she was employed as an art consultant for various galleries (1974-1984) and as the assistant director of the Washburn Gallery (1984-1986). Lauterbach has maintained a career teaching creative writing concurrently with writing and publishing her poetry. She served as a professor of creative writing at various universities, including Brooklyn College (1985-1986), City College, City University of New York, (1989-1998), and the Graduate Center of the University of New York (1993). In 1991 Lauterbach joined the M.F.A. writing faculty at Bard College.\r\n\r\nHer poetry publications include: Book One (Spring Street Press: New York, NY, 1975), Clamor (Viking: New York, NY, 1991), And for Example (Viking: New York, NY, 1994), and Or to Begin Again (Penguin Books: New York, NY, 2009). Lauterbach also published Greeks with Bruce Boice (Hollow Press: Baltimore, MD, 1985) and an essay The Night Sky: Writings on the Poetics of Experience (Viking: New York, NY, 2005). She has contributed to a number of periodicals including American Letters and Commentary, American Poetry Review, Artforum, and Denver Quarterly.",
