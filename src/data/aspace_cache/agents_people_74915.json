          "content": "Mary Welsh Hemingway, journalist and fourth wife of the author Ernest Hemingway, was born on April 5, 1908, in Walker, Minnesota, the daughter of Thomas James Welsh, a lumberman, and Adeline Beehler Welsh. She studied journalism at Northwestern University, and edited The American Florist before joining the staff of The Chicago Daily News in 1932. In 1937 she moved to London to write for The Daily Express, and beginning in 1940 she covered World War II in Europe for Time and Life magazines. Throughout her first two marriages, to Lawrence Cook and to Australian journalist Noel Monks, she used the name Mary Welsh professionally.\r\n\r\nMary Welsh met Hemingway in London in 1944, and they were married two years later in Havana, Cuba. During their fifteen years together, Mary Hemingway continued to work as a free-lance journalist but also supported her husband's writing, answering correspondence and typing his manuscripts. The couple kept homes in Idaho and Cuba, and travelled widely. Following Hemingway's suicide in 1961, she served as his literary executor and saw to press several posthumous works, including A Moveable Feast, established the Ernest Hemingway Foundation to support young writers, and arranged for the donation of his papers to the Kennedy Presidential Library. In 1976 she published her autobiography, How it Was, which focuses chiefly on her time with Ernest Hemingway.\r\n\r\nIn her later years Mary Hemingway lived in New York, where she died on November 26, 1986.",
