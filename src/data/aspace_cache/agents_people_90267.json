          "content": "Thurgood Marshall was an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, serving from October 1967 to October 1991. Marshall was the Court's 96th justice and its first African-American justice. Marshall began his legal career in 1936 as Counsel to the Baltimore, Maryland branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In 1940, the NAACP created the Legal Defense and Education Fund, with Marshall as its Director and Counsel. He argued the case of Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka before the Supreme Court of the United States, a case in which racial segregation in United States public schools was declared unconstitutional. In 1961 President Kennedy appointed Marshall to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Four years later, President Lyndon Johnson appointed him to be Solicitor General of the United States. On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Marshall to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark. Thurgood Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69-11 on August 30, 1967.",
