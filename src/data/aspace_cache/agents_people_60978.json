He was born in Red Oak, Missouri, a son of William Pinkney \"Pink\" Irwin (1848-1924) and Mary Frances \"Molly\" Elmore Irwin (1849-1943). He had two brothers who also worked as photographers, John Allison Irwin (1869-1942), and Marvin Elmore Irwin (1881-1961), as well as two sisters, Lou Ida Irwin (1873-1873) and Minnie Pearl Irwin Bock Mitchell Sawyers (1878-1963). Between 1873 and 1878, the Irwin family moved from Missouri to their Buck Horn Ranch near Lometa in Lampasas County, Texas.\r\n\r\nAround 1893, Ed Irwin learned photography from J. H. Hurl in Texas, and opened a photography studio in Chickasha, Indian Territory (later Oklahoma). Around 1895, he became partners with S. Jack Mankins (1871-1910), and they operated a photography studio, Irwin & Mankins, also known as the Blue Tent Gallery, in Chickasha until 1903, as well as studios in Duncan, Indian Territory, and Richmond, Texas. In 1903, Ed probably was a partner in the Irwin-Walk Studio in Lampasas, Texas.\r\n\r\nIn July 1900, Ed married Carrie Matilda \"Tillie\" Allen Irwin (1878-1922). In 1904, they relocated briefly to Silver City, New Mexico, where they likely continued to own a ranch, and then to Bisbee, Arizona, where Ed operated a studio with his brothers, John and Marvin, until 1922. Marvin also operated a photography studio in Douglas, Arizona, from 1912 to 1945.\r\n\r\nIn 1922, Ed moved his studio to Douglas, Arizona, probably collaborating with Marvin, and continued to photograph until his death.",
